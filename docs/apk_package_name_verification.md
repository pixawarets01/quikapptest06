# APK Package Name Verification System

## Overview

The QuikApp platform now includes an automated APK package name verification system that runs after every Android build to ensure the generated APK contains the correct package name as specified by the user's `PKG_NAME` environment variable.

## Purpose

This verification system prevents package name mismatch issues like:

- Google Play Console upload failures due to incorrect package names
- App Store rejections for wrong bundle identifiers
- Distribution problems with wrong app identifiers
- Silent failures where apps are built with default package names

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Integration

The verification runs automatically after every Android build in all workflows:

- ✅ `android-free` workflow
- ✅ `android-paid` workflow
- ✅ `android-publish` workflow
- ✅ `combined` workflow (Android portion)

### 2. Verification Process

```bash
📦 Verifying package name in built APK...
🔍 Starting APK package name verification...
📦 Expected package name: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp
✅ Found APK at: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
📁 APK size: 44.9MB
🔧 Locating aapt tool...
✅ Found aapt at: /path/to/android-sdk/build-tools/34.0.0/aapt
🔍 Extracting package information from APK...
📦 APK Package Name: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp
✅ Package name verification PASSED
🎉 APK contains correct package name: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp
```

### 3. Additional Information Extracted

The verification also extracts and logs useful APK information:

- **Version Name**: App version (e.g., "1.1.0")
- **Version Code**: Build number (e.g., "2")
- **App Label**: Display name
- **Min SDK Version**: Minimum Android version
- **Target SDK Version**: Target Android version

## Script Location

```bash
lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh
```

## Technical Details

### APK Location Detection

The script automatically searches for APK files in multiple locations:

```bash
# Searched locations (in order)
- build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
- build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
- android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
- output/android/app-release.apk
```

### AAPT Tool Discovery

The script dynamically locates the Android Asset Packaging Tool (aapt):

```bash
# Searched locations
- $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/build-tools/*/aapt
- $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/*/aapt
- /usr/local/android-sdk/build-tools/*/aapt
- /opt/android-sdk/build-tools/*/aapt
- which aapt (system PATH)
```

### Package Name Extraction

Uses `aapt dump badging` to extract package information:

```bash
# Command used
aapt dump badging app-release.apk | grep "package: name"

# Example output
package: name='com.garbcode.garbcodeapp' versionCode='2' versionName='1.1.0'
```

## Integration Points

### Android Main Script

```bash
# Added after build completion, before artifact processing
if [ -f "lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh" ]; then
    chmod +x lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh
    if lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh; then
        log "✅ Package name verification successful"
    else
        log "❌ Package name verification failed"
        log "⚠️ Continuing with build process despite verification failure"
    fi
fi
```

### Combined Workflow Script

```bash
# Added after Android build completion
if [ -f "lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh" ]; then
    chmod +x lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh
    if lib/scripts/android/verify_package_name.sh; then
        log "✅ Android package name verification successful"
    else
        log "❌ Android package name verification failed"
        log "⚠️ Continuing with build process despite verification failure"
    fi
fi
```

```

## Error Handling

### Non-Fatal Errors

The verification system is designed to be **non-fatal** - if verification fails, the build continues but logs the failure for investigation:

```bash
❌ Package name verification failed
⚠️ Continuing with build process despite package name verification failure
```

This ensures that:

- Builds don't fail due to verification issues
- Problems are logged for investigation
- Users can still get their APK files
- Issues can be debugged and fixed

### Common Error Scenarios

#### 1. APK Not Found

```bash
❌ Error: APK not found in any expected location
🔍 Searched locations:
   - build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   - build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   - android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   - output/android/app-release.apk
```

#### 2. AAPT Tool Not Found

```bash
❌ Error: aapt tool not found
💡 Ensure Android SDK Build Tools are installed
💡 Check ANDROID_SDK_ROOT or ANDROID_HOME environment variables
```

#### 3. Package Extraction Failed

```bash
❌ Error: Could not extract package information from APK
💡 APK might be corrupted or aapt version incompatible
```

## Enhanced Package Name Update System

### 🔧 **NEW: Missing Package Attribute Fix**

The verification system identified a common issue where **AndroidManifest.xml** was missing the `package` attribute entirely. This has been fixed with an enhanced package name update script.

#### Problem Identified

```xml
<!-- BEFORE: Missing package attribute -->
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <application ...>
```

#### Solution Implemented

```xml
<!-- AFTER: Package attribute added -->
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="com.garbcode.garbcodeapp">
    <application ...>
```

### Enhanced Update Script Features

#### 1. **Missing Package Attribute Detection**

The enhanced script now detects when `AndroidManifest.xml` is missing the `package` attribute entirely:

```bash
[PKG_UPDATE] 🔍 Ensuring package attribute is present in AndroidManifest.xml
[PKG_UPDATE]    📝 Adding missing package attribute: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp
[PKG_UPDATE]    ✅ Added package attribute: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp
```

#### 2. **Automatic Package Attribute Addition**

```bash
# Function: ensure_package_attribute()
# - Checks if package attribute exists
# - Adds it if missing
# - Updates it if present but incorrect
```

#### 3. **Comprehensive File Updates**

The enhanced script now handles:

- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Adds/updates `package` attribute
- **build.gradle.kts**: Updates `applicationId` and `namespace`
- **Java/Kotlin files**: Updates package declarations and directory structure
- **iOS files**: Updates bundle identifiers (combined workflows)

### Script Location

```bash
lib/scripts/android/update_package_name.sh
```

### Enhanced Execution Flow

```bash
# 1. Scan for old package names
[PKG_UPDATE] 🔍 Scanning for old package names to replace...

# 2. Update existing package references
[PKG_UPDATE] 📦 Found com.example.quikapptest06 - updating to com.garbcode.garbcodeapp

# 3. Ensure package attribute is present (NEW)
[PKG_UPDATE] 🔍 Ensuring package attribute is present in AndroidManifest.xml
[PKG_UPDATE]    ✅ Added package attribute: com.garbcode.garbcodeapp

# 4. Clean up build artifacts
[PKG_UPDATE] 🧹 Cleaning up build artifacts after package name changes...
```
